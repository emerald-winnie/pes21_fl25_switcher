# Steam PES 2021 & Football Life 2025 Switcher

Here's a simple way to switch between the Steam version of PES 2021 and Football Life 2025 within the same folder.

Place "game_folder" files where you have installed Steam PES 2021 game, default location:

'''
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\eFootball PES 2021
'''

Place "save_folder" files in your save location, which is usually in:

'''
C:\Users\Username\OneDrive\Documents\KONAMI\eFootball PES 2021 SEASON UPDATE\76561197990587099\save

or use this to get there faster:

%USERPROFILE%\Documents\KONAMI\eFootball PES 2021 SEASON UPDATE\76561197990587099\save
'''

The "marco" text file is there for debugging purposes and let you know if the scripts are working. It should switch between "marco" and "polo" each time you run the switcher.
